Digital Stethoscope with Multi-Sensor Health Monitoring

Overview

This project implements a Digital Stethoscope prototype using the ESP32-WROOM-32 development board.
It integrates multiple biomedical sensors to measure ECG, heart rate, SpO‚ÇÇ, body temperature, and stethoscope mic signals, displaying them in real-time on an OLED screen and the Arduino Serial Plotter.

This prototype validates the core system for future MVP development, where discrete modules will be integrated into a single compact PCB or custom IC.

---How This Helps in MVP

Prototype verifies core functions (signal acquisition, processing, display)

Provides a working demo for client validation

MVP stage will focus on:

Miniaturization (custom PCB instead of modules)

Power optimization (battery management)

Wireless connectivity (BLE/WiFi)

Noise cancellation (borrowing ideas from ANC headsets for mic/ECG filtering)

--- Future Enhancements

Add multi-lead ECG support (3-lead)

Integrate BLE/WiFi data streaming to mobile/PC app

On-device AI-based anomaly detection

Noise reduction using digital filtering (FIR/IIR, adaptive filters, ANC concepts)

Rechargeable Li-ion battery with charging circuit
